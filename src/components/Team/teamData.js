Over the last decade living in Los Angeles, I have had the privilege of creating a diverse range of projects from charity galas, fundraisers, pop-ups; with a focus on youth education and empowerment, homelessness, health and wellness, sustainability, and mental well-being.

I currently consult crypto and NFT related companies on their social impact reach, assisting in allocating funds to incredible causes that closely match the company\'s core missions and goals. ',

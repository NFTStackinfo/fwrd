      'For as long as I’ve been alive, I knew I wasn’t meant to fit in. I grew up competing in latin dance in Romania. Later I moved to the US and attended The University of Georgia where I combined Economics with aerial dance. A balanced life was always the goal. I opened a trampoline fitness center that then turned into a full family entertainment trampoline park with VR and an American Ninja course. I moved from web1 to web2 in June 2020 ,when I launched FWRD, an anti-aging company and traveled the world learning and growing for the next 14 months. In 2022 I saw clearly that community comes first and I am building a space where we can be well and also vibe. Feel good and do good. That’s what Elementals is for me. We co-create and co-own every asset, both real and digital. We grow and decide together. We live together. We win together.',

      'I grew up in a small town in the UK and then moved to New Orleans when I was a teenager. I spent most of my early years in competitive dance and running track. I then moved on to fashion and have spent the last 10 years of my life styling, modeling, and designing.  I’m currently creating my own slow fashion, unisex clothing line with fabrics I’ve collected from around the world.  Web3 has so many opportunities in fashion and I love how many projects are supporting women and their art.',
